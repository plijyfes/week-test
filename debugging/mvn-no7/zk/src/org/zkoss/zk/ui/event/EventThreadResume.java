/**
 * Used to listen after the event processing thread is resumed.

 * <p>How this interface is used.
 * <ol>
 * <li>First, you specify a class that implements this interface
 * in WEB-INF/zk.xml as a listener.
 * </li>
 * <li>Then, when a suspended event thread is being resumed,
 * an instance of the specified class is constructed and
 * {@link #beforeResume} is called first in the main thread (i.e., the servlet
 * thread), right before resuming.
 * And then, {@link #afterResume} is invoked in the event processing thread,
 * after the thread is resumed.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>In addition to resuming normally, a suspended event thread might be aborted
 * (usually caused by destroying the desktop owning the event thread).
 * In this case, {@link #abortResume} is called instead of {@link #beforeResume}
 * and {@link #afterResume}.
