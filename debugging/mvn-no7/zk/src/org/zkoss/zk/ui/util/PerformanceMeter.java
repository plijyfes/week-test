/**
 * An application-level listener to measure the performance of the processing of client
 * requests.
 *
 * <p>Note: ZK doesn't fork another low-priority thread to call the
 * methods defined in this listener. It is the implementation's job to
 * minimize the overhead when calculating the performance data.
 *
 * <p>There are two kind of requests: loading a page (regular HTTP requests)
 * and AU updates (a.k.a., Ajax requests).
 * When loading a page, {@link #requestStartAtClient} might not be called
 * (since the browser doesn't carry the initial time in the request),
 * and the request ID will be the desktop's ID.
 * For AU updates, {@link #requestStartAtClient} must be called
 * and the request ID a desktop-wide unique ID to identify a request.
 *
 * <p>To monitor the performance of each event and execution, you
 * can also implement {@link ExecutionMonitor}.
