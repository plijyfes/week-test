	<p>Internal interfaces of user interfaces and factories (behind the scene).
	Most user interface, such as <a href="../Component.html">Component</a>,
	has an internal interface, such as <a href="ComponentCtrl.html">ComponentCtrl</a>,
	used only by ZK internals. Application developers shall never use them.</p>
