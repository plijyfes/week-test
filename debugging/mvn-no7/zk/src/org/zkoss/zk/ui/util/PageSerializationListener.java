 * <p>When a page is going to be serialized, it checks every

 * listener ({@link Page#addEventListener}), and
 * variable resolver ({@link Page#addVariableResolver})
 * to see whether this interface is implemented.
 * If implemented, {@link #willSerialize} will be called.
 * Similarly, {@link #didDeserialize} is called if the page has
 * been deserialized.
