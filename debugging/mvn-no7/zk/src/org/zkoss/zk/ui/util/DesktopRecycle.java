/**
 * Used to recycle the desktop ({@link Desktop}). By recycling the desktop,
 * we mean to re-use the same desktop for the same URI if applicable.
 * For example, if an user navigates to other URL and navigates back, the application
 * can re-use the same desktop (by implementing this interface).
 * It is useful if the page takes a lot of time to prepare.
 *
 * <p>A typical implementation (such as {@link org.zkoss.zkmax.ui.util.DesktopRecycle})
 * caches the desktop when {@link #beforeRemove} is called,
 * and then return it if {@link #beforeService} matches it.
 *
 * <p>Please refer to <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/Performance_Tips/Reuse_Desktops">Performance Tips</a>
