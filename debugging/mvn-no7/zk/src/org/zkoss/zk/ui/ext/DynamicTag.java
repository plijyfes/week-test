/**
 * Represents a component is used to represent a broad range of tags.
 *
 * <p>For example, org.zkoss.zhtml.Raw is used to generate any HTML tags
 * that doesn't have the ZK counterpart. Reason: there are too many
 * HTML extended tags available and developers might choose to use them.
 *
 * <p>How to use:
 * <ol>
 * <li>First, extends a class from {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.AbstractComponent}
 * and implements this interface</li>
 * <li>Declares the class in lang.xml by enclosing it with &lt;dynamic-tag&gt;.
 * Then, any tag that ZK doesn't understand, will use the class.</li>
 * </ol>
